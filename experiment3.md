# Experiment 3 - Progessively Animated Text Effect

[Click here to see experiment](/exp3_poem/index.html)

I made an animated poem that reveals itself progressively through the use of timers, alpha blending and fade-in effects. The poem is a playful reflection on the project; it demonstrates how simple code can be experimented with slightly differently to create something completely new. The text in each of the first three lines resembles the different experiments I did, highlighting how I enjoy the creativity of i,t with the final line being a reminder to continue building one line at a time, something new.
