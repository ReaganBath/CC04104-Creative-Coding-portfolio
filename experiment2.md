# Experiment 2 - Brush Effect

[Click here to see experiment](/exp2_brush/index.html)

I created a brush tool that allows users to draw on the page with the option of 4 different styles, from a plain black line to colourful shapes. I experimented with this by setting conditions to detect mouse input for drawing and keys 1-4 to switch through brushes.
